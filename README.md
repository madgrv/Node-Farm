## About

Node-Farm is a simple web application built with Node.js that simulates a farm's product inventory. It allows users to view available farm products, their details, and has basic navigation. The project serves as a practical introduction to building server-side applications using Node.js and demonstrates concepts such as routing, handling HTTP requests, and working with data.

The primary goal of Node-Farm is to provide a hands-on learning experience for beginners to understand how to create server-side applications and interact with the backend to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data.
